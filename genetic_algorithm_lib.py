        The constructor of the GA class accepts all parameters required to create an instance of the GA class. It validates such parameters.

        num_generations: Number of generations.
        num_parents_mating: Number of solutions to be selected as parents in the mating pool.

        fitness_func: Accepts a function that must accept 2 parameters (a single solution and its index in the population) and return the fitness value of the solution. Available starting from PyGAD 1.0.17 until 1.0.20 with a single parameter representing the solution. Changed in PyGAD 2.0.0 and higher to include the second parameter representing the solution index.

        initial_population: A user-defined initial population. It is useful when the user wants to start the generations with a custom initial population. It defaults to None which means no initial population is specified by the user. In this case, PyGAD creates an initial population using the 'sol_per_pop' and 'num_genes' parameters. An exception is raised if the 'initial_population' is None while any of the 2 parameters ('sol_per_pop' or 'num_genes') is also None.
        sol_per_pop: Number of solutions in the population. 
        num_genes: Number of parameters in the function.

        init_range_low: The lower value of the random range from which the gene values in the initial population are selected. It defaults to -4. Available in PyGAD 1.0.20 and higher.
        init_range_high: The upper value of the random range from which the gene values in the initial population are selected. It defaults to -4. Available in PyGAD 1.0.20.
        # It is OK to set the value of any of the 2 parameters ('init_range_high' and 'init_range_high') to be equal, higher or lower than the other parameter (i.e. init_range_low is not needed to be lower than init_range_high).

        parent_selection_type: Type of parent selection.
        keep_parents: If 0, this means the parents of the current populaiton will not be used at all in the next population. If -1, this means all parents in the current population will be used in the next population. If set to a value > 0, then the specified value refers to the number of parents in the current population to be used in the next population. In some cases, the parents are of high quality and thus we do not want to loose such some high quality solutions. If some parent selection operators like roulette wheel selection (RWS), the parents may not be of high quality and thus keeping the parents might degarde the quality of the population.
        K_tournament: When the value of 'parent_selection_type' is 'tournament', the 'K_tournament' parameter specifies the number of solutions from which a parent is selected randomly.

        crossover_type: Type of the crossover opreator. If  crossover_type=None, then the crossover step is bypassed which means no crossover is applied and thus no offspring will be created in the next generations. The next generation will use the solutions in the current population.
        mutation_type: Type of the mutation opreator. If mutation_type=None, then the mutation step is bypassed which means no mutation is applied and thus no changes are applied to the offspring created using the crossover operation. The offspring will be used unchanged in the next generation.

        mutation_by_replacement: An optional bool parameter. It works only when the selected type of mutation is random (mutation_type="random"). In this case, setting mutation_by_replacement=True means replace the gene by the randomly generated value. If False, then it has no effect and random mutation works by adding the random value to the gene.

        mutation_percent_genes: Percentage of genes to mutate which defaults to 10%. This parameter has no action if the parameter mutation_num_genes exists.
        mutation_num_genes: Number of genes to mutate which defaults to None. If the parameter mutation_num_genes exists, then no need for the parameter mutation_percent_genes.
        random_mutation_min_val: The minimum value of the range from which a random value is selected to be added to the selected gene(s) to mutate. It defaults to -1.0.
        random_mutation_max_val: The maximum value of the range from which a random value is selected to be added to the selected gene(s) to mutate. It defaults to 1.0.

        callback_generation: If not None, then it accepts a function to be called after each generation. This function must accept a single parameter representing the instance of the genetic algorithm.
